Hello!
Our group's name is the PKI classroom reassignment 

Our web project's purpose is for reassignment of classroom after the classes are filled
Some reasons this might happen includes:
  Enrollment exceed the max enrollment
  A waitlist of people want to enroll and the school wants to get as many people in the course

Our project will 
1. reassign classroom into a larger classroom when enrollment is too big
2. Time change either affected because of the reassignment or just want a time change
3. Give user some possible choice to choose what changes they want when they want to change classroom
4. Print out a per classroom CSV files which will show all the courses per classroom 

Release Notes-
Local Copies of Schedule files in program
Parser functioning with single document tester, should work with multidocument but untested
Web pages exist, awaiting connection to real content

milestone 2:
1. display some csv data on front-end
2. JSP allow users to add course change, course change can go up to 5
