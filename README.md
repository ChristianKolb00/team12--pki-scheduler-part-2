Hello!
Our group's name is the PKI classroom reassignment 

Our web project's purpose is for reassignment of classroom after the classes are filled
Some reasons this might happen includes:
  Enrollment exceed the max enrollment
  A waitlist of people want to enroll and the school wants to get as many people in the course

Our project will 
1. reassign classroom into a larger classroom when enrollment is too big
2. Time change either affected because of the reassignment or just want a time change
3. Give user some possible choice to choose what changes they want when they want to change classroom
4. Print out a per classroom CSV files which will show all the courses per classroom 

Release Notes-
Local Copies of Schedule files in program
Parser functioning with single document tester, should work with multidocument but untested
Web pages exist, awaiting connection to real content

milestone 2:
1. display some csv data on front-end
2. JSP allow users to add course change, course change can go up to 5
3. Parser can now filter to only PKI classes
4. Array of all PKI Courses can now be returned
5. Array of Course titles can now be returned
6. General TimeTable object created that will be used to prevent scheduling conflicts
7. Room and Professor created that inherit all TimeTable methods
